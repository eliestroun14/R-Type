# Documentation

This section contains guides for writing and organizing the R-Type documentation.

## Writing Guide

The **[Writing Guide](writing-guide.md)** is your complete reference for contributing to the documentation. It covers:

- Project structure and file organization
- How to add a new documentation page
- Navigation and routing system

## Getting Started

To add documentation:

1. Create a `.md` file in the appropriate `docs/` folder
2. Write your content using Markdown
3. Add the page to the navigation in `mkdocs.yml`
4. Commit and push your changes

ReadTheDocs will automatically rebuild and deploy the documentation.
